# Evolve

> A virtual arena designed to simulate (very) basic evolution patterns in the natural world.

Evolve is a small ThreeJS experimentation project. It was developped to experiment a bit with WebGL and WebWorkers.

It is using:
- (VueGL)[https://vue-gl.github.io/] library
- (R-Tree)[https://github.com/mourner/rbush] javascript library
